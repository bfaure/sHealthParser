# Introduction
The sHealth android application gathers tons of data about user step patterns but does not provide any real means of viewing that data anywhere but on the mobile platform. The step data can be exported to a simple .csv format and that is the data this application hopes to be a help in viewing/editing. After exporting the .csv files, put the step data into the steps/data folder then run gui.py. This will open up a UI window where the user can view different elements of their data and narrow down the selection based on certain attributes.
